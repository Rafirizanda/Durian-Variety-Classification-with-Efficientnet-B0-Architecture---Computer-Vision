# üçà Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network Based on EfficientNet-B0 Architecture for Durian Variety Classification

## üìñ Project Overview

Durian (*Durio zibethinus Murr*) is one of the most popular tropical fruits in Southeast Asia with high economic value. In Indonesia, durian production has shown a **consistent increase over the past five years**, reaching nearly **2 million tons in 2024** according to official statistics (BPS). Durian is not only a key agricultural commodity but also contributes to **agrotourism and international trade**, making its quality and varietal classification crucial for farmers, sellers, and consumers.

However, challenges remain in the **accurate identification of durian varieties**. Currently, classification is often performed manually, requiring expert knowledge and leaving room for **market manipulation** (e.g., selling common durian as premium ‚ÄúMusang King‚Äù). Such misclassification leads to consumer distrust and price instability in the market.  

To address these issues, this project leverages **Deep Learning and Image Processing** to build an automated durian variety classification system. Specifically, we implement a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using EfficientNet-B0 architecture**, which is well-known for its **balance between accuracy and computational efficiency**.  

EfficientNet-B0 offers several advantages:
- Lightweight architecture (5.3M parameters, 0.39B FLOPs) ‚Üí suitable for real-time applications.  
- Strong performance in fruit image datasets (up to 99%+ accuracy).  
- Supports **transfer learning with ImageNet pre-trained weights**, reducing training time and improving accuracy with limited labeled data.  

By experimenting with **hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, dense layers, epochs)**, this project aims to develop a robust classification model that can accurately recognize **7 durian varieties**. The system is expected to contribute towards:  
- Enhancing transparency in the durian market.  
- Reducing fraud in varietal labeling.  
- Supporting farmers and sellers in maintaining quality assurance.  
- Opening opportunities for **real-time applications** in agriculture and agrotourism.
