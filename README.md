# Durian-Variety-Classification-with-Efficientnet-B0-Architecture---Data-Science

"Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network Based on EfficientNet-B0 Architecture for Durian Variety Classification‚Äù

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on the EfficientNet-B0 architecture to classify different varieties of durians. The model is trained using transfer learning to achieve high accuracy in recognizing durian varieties from image datasets.
